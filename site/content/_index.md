    4-H is an organization for young people and their families focused on
    positive youth development. The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship,
    leadership, responsibility and life skills in youth through experiential
    learning programs and a positive youth development approach. We strive to
    engage youth to reach their full potential, working and learning with caring
    adults. The 4-H motto is “To make the best better”, while its slogan is
    “Learn by doing”.

    A recent report from Tufts University shows that 4-H youth excel beyond
    their peers. 4-H’ers are about:


    - Four times more likely to make contributions to their communities (Grades
    7–12)<br>

    - Two times more likely to be civic minded and active (Grades 8–12)

    - Two times more likely to make healthier choices (Grade 7)

    - Two times more likely to participate in Science, Engineering and Computer
    Technology programs during out-of-school time (Grades 10–12) and

    - 4-H girls are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more
    likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in
    other out-of-school time activities
